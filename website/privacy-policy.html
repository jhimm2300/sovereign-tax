<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 10, 2026</p>

<p>Sovereign Tax ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have. It applies to the Sovereign Tax desktop application ("Software") and the Sovereign Tax website.</p>

<div class="highlight-box">
  <p><strong>The short version:</strong> Sovereign Tax is a local, offline application. The Software itself collects zero personal data. We have no servers, no accounts, no analytics, and no telemetry. Your financial data never leaves your device. The only data we may receive is what you voluntarily provide during the purchase process.</p>
</div>

<h2>1. Information the Software Collects</h2>
<p><strong>None.</strong></p>
<p>The Sovereign Tax desktop application:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Does <strong>not</strong> collect, transmit, or store any data on external servers</li>
  <li>Does <strong>not</strong> create user accounts or require personal information to operate</li>
  <li>Does <strong>not</strong> include analytics, telemetry, tracking pixels, or usage monitoring of any kind</li>
  <li>Does <strong>not</strong> use cookies, local storage, or fingerprinting outside of its own encrypted local data store</li>
  <li>Does <strong>not</strong> require an internet connection to function (except for optional live BTC price fetching)</li>
  <li>Encrypts all stored data locally on your device using AES-256-GCM encryption</li>
</ul>
<p>All transaction data, tax calculations, reports, and other information you enter into the Software remain on your device at all times. We have no ability to access, view, or recover your data.</p>

<h2>2. Information Collected During Purchase</h2>
<p>When you purchase Sovereign Tax, the following information may be collected by our payment processor:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Email address</strong> &mdash; used to deliver your download link and purchase receipt</li>
  <li><strong>Payment information</strong> &mdash; processed by the payment provider (we do not see or store your full credit card number, bank details, or wallet addresses)</li>
  <li><strong>IP address</strong> &mdash; collected automatically by the payment processor for fraud prevention</li>
  <li><strong>Transaction details</strong> &mdash; purchase amount, date, and product purchased</li>
</ul>
<p>This information is collected and processed by our third-party payment processor, not by Sovereign Tax directly. We only receive the information necessary to fulfill your order (typically your email address and confirmation of payment).</p>

<h2>3. How We Use Purchase Information</h2>
<p>The limited information we receive from the purchase process is used exclusively to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Deliver the Software to you (download link via email)</li>
  <li>Provide customer support if you contact us</li>
  <li>Notify you of important updates to the Software (if applicable)</li>
  <li>Process refund requests</li>
</ul>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> use your information for marketing, advertising, profiling, or any purpose unrelated to your purchase and use of the Software. We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, trade, or share your personal information with third parties for their marketing purposes.</p>

<h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>

<p><strong>Payment Processor:</strong> Purchases are processed by our third-party payment provider. Their collection and use of your information is governed by their own privacy policy. We encourage you to review the payment processor's privacy policy before making a purchase.</p>

<p><strong>CoinGecko API (Optional):</strong> The Software may optionally fetch current Bitcoin price data from the CoinGecko API. This request contains no personal information, no user identifiers, and no financial data. It is a simple public API call to retrieve the current BTC/USD exchange rate. No cookies or tokens are sent. You can use the Software entirely offline without this feature.</p>

<h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
<p><strong>Software data:</strong> All data within the Software is stored locally on your device and encrypted. We have no access to it and do not retain any copies. If you uninstall the Software or clear its data, that data is permanently deleted from your device.</p>
<p><strong>Purchase data:</strong> We retain the minimal purchase information (email address and transaction record) for as long as necessary to provide support and comply with applicable legal and accounting obligations. You may request deletion of your purchase data by contacting us (see Section 9 below).</p>

<h2>6. Data Security</h2>
<p>The Software employs industry-standard AES-256-GCM encryption with PBKDF2 key derivation to protect all locally stored data. Your PIN is never stored in plaintext. However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of data on your device. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device and PIN.</p>

<h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Sovereign Tax is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe that a child under 18 has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

<h2>8. International Users</h2>
<p>Since the Software operates entirely offline with no data transmission, there are no cross-border data transfer concerns related to the use of the Software itself. Purchase data processed by our payment provider may be stored and processed in the United States or other countries where the payment provider operates. By making a purchase, you consent to this transfer.</p>

<h2>9. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
<p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Access:</strong> You may request a copy of any personal information we hold about you</li>
  <li><strong>Correction:</strong> You may request that we correct any inaccurate information</li>
  <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You may request that we delete your purchase data</li>
  <li><strong>Portability:</strong> You may request your data in a portable format</li>
</ul>
<p>To exercise any of these rights, contact us at the email provided with your purchase. We will respond within 30 days. Note that we may retain certain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.</p>
<p>For data stored within the Software itself, you have full control at all times. You can export, back up, or delete your data directly within the application without contacting us.</p>

<h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will notify you through the Software or other reasonable means. The "Effective Date" at the top of this page indicates when this policy was last revised. Your continued use of the Software after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

<h2>11. Contact</h2>
<p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, contact us at the email address provided with your purchase confirmation.</p>
