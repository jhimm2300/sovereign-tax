<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 10, 2026</p>

<p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Sovereign Tax desktop application ("Software," "App," or "Product") developed and distributed by Sovereign Tax ("we," "us," or "our"). By purchasing, downloading, installing, or using the Software, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not accept these Terms, you will not install, access, or otherwise use the Software.</p>

<div class="highlight-box">
  <p><strong>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY.</strong> They contain an agreement to arbitrate disputes, a class action waiver, a limitation on the time period in which claims may be brought, and other important provisions affecting your legal rights.</p>
</div>

<h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
<p>By using the Software, you represent and warrant that you are at least <strong>18 years of age</strong> and have the legal capacity to enter into a binding agreement. If you are using the Software on behalf of a company, organization, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms. We disclaim any liability for any misrepresentation of your age or authority.</p>

<h2>2. License Grant</h2>
<p>Upon purchase, we grant you a <strong>non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, perpetual license</strong> to install and use one copy of the Software on up to <strong>two (2) devices</strong> that you personally own or control. This is a one-time purchase &mdash; no subscription or recurring fees are required.</p>
<p>You may not:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Redistribute, sublicense, rent, lease, loan, sell, resell, or otherwise transfer the Software or your license to any third party</li>
  <li>Reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, or attempt to derive the source code of the Software</li>
  <li>Modify, copy, create derivative works from, or frame any portion of the Software</li>
  <li>Remove, alter, or obscure any proprietary notices, labels, or branding on the Software</li>
  <li>Use the Software to provide tax calculation, tax preparation, or financial services to third parties on a commercial basis</li>
  <li>Assign or transfer these Terms or any rights or obligations hereunder, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent; any attempted assignment in violation of this provision will be null and void</li>
</ul>
<p>We may assign or transfer these Terms, in whole or in part, without restriction.</p>

<h2>3. Nature of the Software</h2>
<p>Sovereign Tax is a <strong>local, offline desktop application</strong> that runs entirely on your device. The Software:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Does not collect, transmit, or store any of your data on external servers</li>
  <li>Does not require an internet connection to function (except for optional live BTC price fetching)</li>
  <li>Does not create user accounts or require personal information to operate</li>
  <li>Encrypts all stored data locally on your device using AES-256-GCM encryption</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight-box">
  <p><strong>Your data is yours alone.</strong> We have no access to your financial data, transaction history, tax calculations, or any other information you enter into the Software. We cannot recover lost data or PINs because we do not have them.</p>
</div>

<h2>4. No Financial, Tax, or Professional Advice; No Fiduciary Relationship</h2>
<p><strong>The Software is a calculation tool, not a tax advisor.</strong> Sovereign Tax is designed to help you organize Bitcoin transaction data and calculate potential capital gains and losses using standard accounting methods (FIFO, LIFO, HIFO, and Specific Identification).</p>
<p><strong>No fiduciary relationship</strong> has been created between you and Sovereign Tax by virtue of your use of the Software.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Software does not provide tax, legal, financial, investment, accounting, or other professional advice</li>
  <li>You are not being represented by an attorney, certified financial planner, certified public accountant, or other regulated professional through your use of the Software</li>
  <li>All calculations, reports, and outputs are for <strong>informational purposes only</strong> and should not be considered a substitute for the services or advice of a competent professional</li>
  <li>You are solely responsible for the accuracy of the data you input</li>
  <li>You are solely responsible for verifying all calculations and tax filings</li>
  <li>Tax laws vary by jurisdiction and change over time &mdash; the Software may not reflect your specific tax obligations</li>
  <li>You should consult a qualified tax professional or certified public accountant before making tax decisions or filing tax returns based on outputs from the Software</li>
  <li>Any information, documents, or reports received from or through the Software may not be appropriate for your particular situation, the assessment of which is your sole and exclusive responsibility</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Accuracy and Data Responsibility</h2>
<p>While we strive to ensure the accuracy of the Software's calculations, we make <strong>no guarantees</strong> that the outputs are error-free or suitable for filing with any tax authority. The accuracy of results depends entirely on the accuracy and completeness of the data you provide.</p>
<p>You are responsible for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ensuring all imported CSV files and manually entered transactions are accurate and complete</li>
  <li>Verifying that the correct accounting method is selected for your tax situation</li>
  <li>Reviewing all generated reports (including Form 8949, Schedule D summaries, and TurboTax exports) before filing</li>
  <li>Maintaining your own backups of your data using the Software's encrypted backup feature</li>
</ul>
<p>You agree that Sovereign Tax is not liable for any errors, omissions, loss, or damage which may be caused by your use of the Software or its outputs, to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>

<h2>6. Data Loss and Recovery</h2>
<p>Because the Software operates entirely offline with local encryption:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>We cannot recover your data</strong> if you lose your device, forget your PIN, or fail to create backups</li>
  <li><strong>We cannot reset your PIN</strong> &mdash; this is a security feature, not a limitation</li>
  <li>You are solely responsible for creating and securely storing encrypted backups</li>
  <li>We strongly recommend backing up your data regularly using the built-in backup feature</li>
  <li>Any damage that may occur to you, through your computer system, or as a result of loss of your data from your use of the Software is your sole responsibility</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Security Disclaimer and Assumption of Risk</h2>
<p>While the Software employs industry-standard encryption (AES-256-GCM) and is designed with security as a priority, <strong>we cannot and do not guarantee that the Software is completely secure or immune from vulnerabilities, exploits, or unauthorized access.</strong> No software, regardless of its design or encryption methods, can guarantee absolute security.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You assume full responsibility for the security of your own data, devices, and operating environment</li>
  <li>You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of the device(s) on which the Software is installed, including keeping your operating system and security software up to date</li>
  <li>You are solely responsible for safeguarding your PIN and ensuring that unauthorized individuals do not gain access to your device or the Software</li>
  <li>Sovereign Tax is not responsible for any unauthorized access to your data resulting from malware, viruses, keyloggers, device theft, compromised operating systems, or any other security vulnerability on your device or network</li>
  <li>Sovereign Tax is not responsible for any data breach, data loss, or security incident arising from circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to vulnerabilities in your operating system, third-party software, or hardware</li>
  <li>You use the Software at your own risk and assume all responsibility for any consequences arising from the storage of sensitive financial data on your device</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SOVEREIGN TAX EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING FROM ANY SECURITY BREACH, UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, OR DATA COMPROMISE RELATING TO YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR THE DEVICE ON WHICH IT IS INSTALLED.</strong></p>

<h2>8. Payment and Refunds</h2>
<p>Sovereign Tax is sold as a <strong>one-time purchase</strong> through our authorized payment processor (currently Gumroad). The purchase price includes the current version of the Software and any future updates we choose to release at no additional charge. Payments made are final and non-refundable unless otherwise determined by Sovereign Tax at its sole discretion.</p>
<p>Payment processing services are provided by third-party payment processors and are subject to their respective terms and conditions. By agreeing to these Terms, you also agree to be bound by the applicable payment processor's terms. We assume no liability or responsibility for any payments you make through third-party processors.</p>
<p>If you experience technical issues that prevent the Software from functioning, contact us and we will work to resolve the issue or process a refund at our discretion. Refunds are not available once you have used the Software to generate, export, or download any tax reports, Form 8949 documents, CSV files, or PDF files.</p>

<h2>9. Updates</h2>
<p>We may release updates to the Software from time to time that include bug fixes, new features, or compatibility improvements. Updates are provided at our discretion and are not guaranteed. When updates are available, you will need to download and install the new version manually.</p>

<h2>10. Intellectual Property</h2>
<p>The Software, including its code, design, user interface, documentation, algorithms, and branding, is protected by copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws. The Sovereign Tax name and logos are trademarks of Sovereign Tax. All rights not expressly granted in these Terms are reserved by Sovereign Tax.</p>
<p>You agree not to copy, modify, create derivative works from, reverse engineer, reverse assemble, or otherwise attempt to discover any source code, sell, assign, sublicense, or otherwise transfer any right in the Software. Nothing in these Terms should be construed as granting any license or right to use any Sovereign Tax trademarks without our prior written permission.</p>

<h2>11. Prohibited Uses</h2>
<p>You may not use the Software to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Facilitate tax evasion, fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing, or any illegal activity</li>
  <li>Provide commercial tax preparation, tax calculation, or financial services to others without a separate commercial license</li>
  <li>Circumvent, remove, alter, deactivate, degrade, or thwart any of the Software's security features or content protections</li>
  <li>Engage in any data mining, scraping, or extraction of the Software's code, data structures, or algorithms</li>
  <li>Use the Software in any manner that violates applicable local, state, national, or international law</li>
</ul>

<h2>12. Competitor Restriction</h2>
<p>No employee, independent contractor, agent, or affiliate of any competing provider of cryptocurrency tax or asset management software is permitted to access, use, or evaluate any portion of the Software without the express written permission of Sovereign Tax. By using the Software, you represent and warrant that you are not a competitor of Sovereign Tax or acting on behalf of a competitor.</p>

<h2>13. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The Software may optionally connect to third-party APIs (such as CoinGecko) solely to fetch current Bitcoin price data. Your access to and use of any third-party service is subject to that service's own terms and conditions. We have no control over and are not responsible for any third-party service, including the accuracy, availability, reliability, or security of information shared by or available through them. No personal or financial data is transmitted to these services. We are not an agent or representative of any third-party service provider.</p>
<p><strong>YOU EXPRESSLY RELIEVE SOVEREIGN TAX FROM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY THAT MAY ARISE FROM YOUR ACCESS TO AND/OR USE OF ANY THIRD-PARTY SERVICES.</strong></p>

<h2>14. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
<div class="highlight-box">
  <p><strong>YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. SOVEREIGN TAX AND ITS DEVELOPERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, ACCURACY, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</strong></p>
  <p>WE MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT (A) THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS; (B) THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE; (C) THE RESULTS OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE; OR (D) THE QUALITY OF ANY REPORTS, INFORMATION, OR OTHER MATERIAL GENERATED BY THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS OR BE SUITABLE FOR FILING WITH ANY TAX AUTHORITY.</p>
  <p>NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER WRITTEN OR ORAL, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM SOVEREIGN TAX OR THROUGH THE SOFTWARE SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS.</p>
</div>

<h2>15. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<div class="highlight-box">
  <p><strong>YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT SOVEREIGN TAX AND ITS DEVELOPERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, OR DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF SOVEREIGN TAX HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE</strong>, resulting from:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The use or the inability to use the Software</li>
    <li>Errors in tax calculations, reports, or outputs</li>
    <li>Penalties, interest, or additional taxes assessed by any tax authority</li>
    <li>Loss of data, whether caused by software malfunction, device failure, or user error</li>
    <li>Financial losses arising from reliance on the Software's outputs</li>
    <li>Any damages arising from unauthorized access to your device</li>
    <li>Any failure, delay, error, or unavailability of any third-party service, including any API or blockchain network</li>
    <li>Statements or conduct of any third party relating to the Software</li>
    <li>Any other matter relating to the Software</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>IN NO EVENT SHALL SOVEREIGN TAX'S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, OR CAUSES OF ACTION EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE.</strong></p>
  <p>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE DISCLAIMER OR EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU OR BE ENFORCEABLE WITH RESPECT TO YOU. IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH ANY PORTION OF THE SOFTWARE OR WITH THESE TERMS, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USE OF THE SOFTWARE.</p>
</div>

<h2>16. Indemnification</h2>
<p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Sovereign Tax, its developers, affiliates, and their respective officers, employees, agents, and licensors (collectively, the "Sovereign Tax Parties") from and against any and all losses, damages, expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, rights, claims, actions of any kind, and injury (including death) arising out of or relating to your use of the Software, any data you input into or generate from the Software, your violation of these Terms, your violation of any rights of another party, or your filing of tax returns based on the Software's outputs.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, you will have no obligation to indemnify any Sovereign Tax Party from or against any liability incurred as a result of such party's gross negligence or willful misconduct. Sovereign Tax reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification under this section, and you agree to cooperate with any reasonable requests assisting our defense. You may not settle or compromise any claim against the Sovereign Tax Parties without our written consent.</p>

<h2>17. Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration</h2>
<div class="highlight-box">
  <p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY &mdash; IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.</strong></p>
</div>

<p><strong>Agreement to Arbitrate:</strong> You agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Sovereign Tax, whether arising out of or relating to these Terms (including any alleged breach thereof), the Software, or any aspect of the relationship between us, will be resolved exclusively through <strong>final and binding arbitration</strong>, rather than in court, except that you may assert individual claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. You agree that, by entering into these Terms, <strong>you and Sovereign Tax are each waiving the right to a trial by jury</strong>. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision.</p>

<p><strong>Class Action Waiver:</strong> YOU AND SOVEREIGN TAX AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER <strong>ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY</strong>, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. Unless both you and Sovereign Tax agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate or join more than one person's or party's claims and may not preside over any form of a consolidated, representative, or class proceeding.</p>

<p><strong>Arbitration Procedures:</strong> Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association's ("AAA") rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned only for very limited reasons.</p>

<p><strong>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution:</strong> Before initiating arbitration, you must first send us a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the claim and the specific relief sought. If we do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or Sovereign Tax may commence arbitration.</p>

<p><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential.</p>

<h2>18. Time Limitation on Claims</h2>
<p>You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, <strong>any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Software or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.</strong></p>

<h2>19. Termination</h2>
<p>Your license to use the Software continues indefinitely unless terminated. We may terminate your license if you violate these Terms. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity may be grounds for termination and may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. Upon termination, you must cease all use of the Software and delete all copies. Termination may be effected without prior notice. Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 21 survive termination.</p>

<h2>20. Export Controls and Compliance</h2>
<p>You will comply with all applicable import and export control and trade and economic sanctions laws and regulations, including those maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"). You represent and warrant that you are not located in, organized in, or a resident of any country or territory that is the target of comprehensive sanctions (including Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and the Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk regions), and that you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties. You will not use the Software in any manner that would result in a violation of any applicable sanctions or anti-money laundering laws.</p>

<h2>21. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
<p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the <strong>laws of the State of Wyoming, United States</strong>, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to these Terms. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration as set forth above, you and Sovereign Tax submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the State of Wyoming.</p>

<h2>22. Changes to These Terms</h2>
<p>We reserve the right to change or modify portions of these Terms at any time. If we make material changes, we will notify you through the Software or through other reasonable means. Your continued use of the Software after the date any such changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms. If you do not agree to the revised Terms, you must discontinue use of the Software.</p>

<h2>23. Electronic Communications</h2>
<p>By using the Software, you consent to receive electronic communications from us (e.g., through the Software interface or email) and you agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.</p>

<h2>24. Force Majeure</h2>
<p>Sovereign Tax shall not be in default or liable for any failure or delay in the performance of its obligations where such failure or delay is due to civil disturbances, riot, epidemic, pandemic, hostilities, war, terrorist attack, embargo, natural disaster, acts of God, flood, fire, sabotage, fluctuations or unavailability of electrical power, network access or equipment, or any other circumstances or causes beyond Sovereign Tax's reasonable control.</p>

<h2>25. Waiver</h2>
<p>The failure of Sovereign Tax to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term.</p>

<h2>26. Severability</h2>
<p>If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the remaining provisions remain in full force and effect.</p>

<h2>27. Entire Agreement</h2>
<p>These Terms (together with any terms incorporated by reference herein) constitute the entire agreement between you and Sovereign Tax regarding the Software and supersede all prior agreements, understandings, or communications, whether written or oral. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.</p>

<p>If you have questions about these Terms, contact us at the email provided with your purchase.</p>
